vagrant-kafka
=============

Vagrant config to setup a partitioned Apache Kafka installation with clustered Apache Zookeeper

This configuration will start and provision 6 CentOS6 VMs:
* Three Apache Zookeeper hosts configured on cluster
* Three Apache Kafka hosts with one broker each

Each host is provisioned with JDK 7 and Kafka 0.8.0

Prerrequisites
-------------------------
* Vagrant
* VirtualBox

Setup
-------------------------

To start it up, just git clone this repo and execute ```vagrant up```. Takes a while the first time as it will download all required dependencies for you.

Kafka is installed on ```/vagranta/src/kafka_2.9.2-0.8.1.1```

Let's test it!
-------------------------

Login to any host with ```vagrant/vagrant```. Some scripts have been included for convenience:

* ```/vagrant/scripts/create_topic.sh <topic name>```: this is a shortcut to create a topic using three replicas and one partition, executes ```/vagrant/src/kafka_2.9.2-0.8.1.1/bin/kafka-create-topic.sh --zookeeper 10.30.3.2:2181 --replica 3 --partition 1 --topic <topic name>```
* Topic details can be listed with ```/vagrant/src/kafka_2.9.2-0.8.1.1/scripts/kafka-list-topic.sh --zookeeper 10.30.3.2:2181```
* ```/vagrant/scripts/producer.sh <topic name>```: this will create a console producer, sending output to the topic created before, executes ```/vagrant/src/kafka_2.9.2-0.8.1.1/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list 10.30.3.10:9092,10.30.3.20,10.30.3.30 --topic <topic name>```
* ```/vagrant/scripts/consumer.sh <topic name>```: this will create a console consumer, getting messages from the topic created before, executes ```/vagrant/src/kafka_2.9.2-0.8.1.1/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --from-beginning --zookeeper 10.30.3.2:2181 --topic <topic name>```

Now if you input anything on the producer, it will show on the consumer.
